## discussion threads
The main panel on the group page, under the desciption, is a list of the most recent discussion threads within the group.

You can search for threads within the group by clicking the search icon.

If a discussion is no longer revelant and you'd rather it wasn't in the list, you can close it. Open the thread, click the dropdown menu, and select _Close thread_. Closed threads can be found if you click "Closed threads" on the discussion list.
