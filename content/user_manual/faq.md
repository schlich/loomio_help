# Where is my confirmation email?

If you don’t receive an email confirming your group registration, you might need to check your spam or junk mail folder – sometimes they end up in there.

# I’ve forgotten my password, what do I do?

If you’ve forgotten your password click the **"Forgot your password?"** link on the [Log in page](https://www.loomio.org/users/sign_in "opens in new tab"). You will be asked to enter the email address associated with your Loomio account and password reset instructions will be sent to this email address.

# Do I need a Loomio account to participate in discussions?

Yes. Even though there are different levels of group privacy, everyone who wishes to participate in a Loomio group needs to have a Loomio account.

# Does it cost to use Loomio?

Check out our pricing plans [here](https://www.loomio.org/pricing "opens Pricing page in new tab").

# Can I sign in with Google, Facebook or Slack?

Yes, see [Single sign-on](getting_started.html#single-sign-on "moves down the page to single sign on").

# How can I set up my own instance of Loomio?

There is an installation guide on our [Github wiki](https://github.com/loomio/loomio/wiki "opens in new tab") and a [Loomio Community sub-group](https://www.loomio.org/g/C7I2YAPN/loomio-community-installing-loomio "opens in new tab) dedicated to support and assistance with local installations. If you're thinking about installing your own version of Loomio, we highly recommend joining this group.

# I have approved membership requests for people who wanted to join my group but they haven’t shown up as members, what’s going on?

If someone who has requested membership to your group hasn’t already got a Loomio account, they will need to create one before they can join your group. After you approve their membership request, they will receive a confirmation email. Following the link in this email will prompt them to create a Loomio account. When their account has been created they will show up as members of your group.

# How can I stop my signature being included in email replies to threads?

There is currently no official standard for distinguishing email signatures from the rest of the email body. To a computer the whole email is just a block of text. The easiest method we have for marking the end of the email body and the beginning of the signature is the double-dash method popularised by Gmail, which involves inserting a double-dash ('--') on its own line between the body of an email and the signature. Other common formats are recognised too, but Gmail's method is very easy to implement. Most programs trying to separate email body from signature (including Loomio) will correctly ignore email signatures if these dashes are included in the right place.

To be sure that your email signature is not included in your comment when you reply by email, you need to begin your signature with a double hyphen on its own line.

# Will Loomio work on my phone or tablet?

Loomio is mobile responsive, so it will work on any device through a browser.

# How can I reactivate my account?

To have your account reactivated, [contact us](https://loomio.org/contact "opens in new tab").

# I’ve deactivated my group, can I restore it?

Deactivated groups can only be restored by a member of the Loomio team. [Contact us](https://loomio.org/contact "opens in new tab") to reactivate your group.

# What if I have a feature to suggest?

We also have an open Loomio Community sub-group dedicated to [Feature Ideas](https://www.loomio.org/g/GN7EFQTK/loomio-community-feature-ideas "opens in new tab"). You can contribute to discussions about new features there, or make suggest your own feature ideas.

# Is there a Loomio API?

We're actively developing and using the API that the new Loomio 1.0 client uses. This implements everything a Loomio client talking to the web service would need. There is currently no server-to-server api, but Loomio is [open source](http://github.com/loomio/loomio "opens in new tab") and we welcome contributions.

# Is it possible to have a Loomio subdomain?

Yes. We can, for example, set up **[your-group-name].loomio.org** as the URL for your group. [Contact us](https://loomio.org/contact "opens in new tab") if you're interested.

# My question is not here

If you have any questions or issues that are not answered through this Help Manual, you can join the [Loomio Community Help](https://www.loomio.org/invitations/716ae5abb84f4a5ea75c "open in new tab to join the group") subgroup. Search and read the existing threads, and start a new one if they don't answer your question, to get help and tips from our community.
